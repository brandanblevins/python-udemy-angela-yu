# Day 1

## Overview

Learn about:

- Printing
- Inputting
- Commenting
- Debugging
- String Manipulation
- Variables


## First exercise

Create a band name generator. It will ask:

- What's the name of the city your grew up in?
- What's your pet's name?


## Notes

### Print function (output)

Print function = print()
Inside parentheses is where you define what you want to print.

Classic `hello world`in Python = print("Hello, world!")

The double quotes around the words within the parentheses tells the computer that it isn't code. Aka a `string`, or string of characters. The double quotes tell the computer the beginning and ending of the string.

Error messages: If you forget a closing quote, for example, you get an error like this:

```
File "main.py", line 3
    print("Hello, world!)
                        ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

Stay attuned to the color of your code (syntax highlighting). With the missing quote, the code editor highlights everything, as opposed to when it is properly coded, which colors the code as expected.
