# Day 1

## Overview

Learn about:

- Printing
- Inputting
- Commenting
- Debugging
- String Manipulation
- Variables


## First exercise

Create a band name generator. It will ask:

- What's the name of the city your grew up in?
- What's your pet's name?


## Notes

### Print function (output)

Print function = print()
Inside parentheses is where you define what you want to print.

Classic `hello world`in Python = print("Hello, world!")

The double quotes around the words within the parentheses tells the computer that it isn't code. Aka a `string`, or string of characters. The double quotes tell the computer the beginning and ending of the string.

Error messages: If you forget a closing quote, for example, you get an error like this:

```
File "main.py", line 3
    print("Hello, world!)
                        ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

Stay attuned to the color of your code (syntax highlighting). With the missing quote, the code editor highlights everything, as opposed to when it is properly coded, which colors the code as expected.

### Exercise - print function

Take the following recipe and turn it into output, exact replica:

```
1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
3. Add 3g of Salt.
4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.
```

My first attempt:

```
print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")
```

Test case passed.

Explanation: Simply need five print statements to output the five lines of the recipe.

### Print modifiers

Add print modifiers to achieve a specific need.

For example: print("She said: "Hello" and then left.")

When the computer sees the double quotes around `Hello`, it thinks the string has ended, and the word `Hello` is a command.

To solve this: print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
Alternate the use of single and double quotes.
In Python, we can define a string (piece of text) using either a single quote or a double quote.
You can also reverse the single and double quotes in this example and get the same thing. The point is the alternation of the type of quotes.

Another option is backslashes: print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.")
The backslashes tell the computer to ignore the double quotes and keep them as text. It's meant to be printed exactly as it is.

Examples that all work:

```
print("A 'single quote' inside a double quote")
print('A "double quote" inside a single quote')
print("Alternatively you can just \"escape\" the quote")
```

My example to add:

```
print('I want to quote someone like this "I\'m quoting them", and that is that.')
```

Had to use the backslash to deal with the apostrophe for `I'm`.


### String manipulation and code intelligence

Example hello world: print("Hello, world!\nHello, world!")

The use of `\n` separates the lines within the same string. You don't want gaps between the `\n`, unless you are trying to add space.


String concatenation: print("Hello" + "Angela")
Use a `+` to combine strings.

String concatenation is taking those separate strings of characters and merging them into one.

**In Python programming, spaces are very important. For example, putting a tab in front of a print function produces an indentation error.**

Code intelligence is a feature within Replit. I already had it turned on. It helps you understand what is going wrong with your code (for example, red squiggly line).


### Debugging practice (string manipulation)

Debug the following code to make it print like the output example:

```
# Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

My attempt:

```
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

The tricky part was making the `"+"` part appear in the output. It also needed an opening quote in the first line, a deletion of the tab/indentation in the third line, and a deletion of one of the opening curls in the fourth line.
